# Space Engineers Scripts
A collection of scripts I have created for [Space Engineers](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/).

Built on top of the brilliant [Malware's Development Kit for SE](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE).

## Scripts
* [Rotor Aligner](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3272710735) - Enables you to align rotors and hinges to specified angles.
* [Grid Renamer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3272722169) - Prefixes all block names on a grid with the grid's name.
